diving into the world of pentesting 

the client establishes a connection to the server, receives a message, and then closes the connection. The server listens for incoming connections, accepts them, sends a message to the client, and then closes the connection. Note that the server script has a potential issue as it closes the connection after sending a single message, preventing further communication.



the client receives a message from the server :

The scanner.py script provides a basic example of using Nmap for network scanning through Python.

The  script bannergraber.py can be useful for quickly gathering information about a service, such as the service version or any other data that the service might provide in its initial response. It's a simple form of reconnaissance that can be part of a larger network scanning or information-gathering process. Keep in mind that banner grabbing might not always work, especially if the service doesn't provide a recognizable banner or if it's configured not to respond to such requests.




the script portscanner.py gets as input from user the ip address and the port and scans the given port outputing if it is open or not
