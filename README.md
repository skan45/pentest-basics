diving into the world of pentesting 

the client establishes a connection to the server, receives a message, and then closes the connection. The server listens for incoming connections, accepts them, sends a message to the client, and then closes the connection. Note that the server script has a potential issue as it closes the connection after sending a single message, preventing further communication.
